# Implementation-and-Comparison-of-Different-Modulation-Schemes


* Investigated the use of Pulse Shaping and Match Filtering for BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK & 16-QAM.
*  Observed an average Symbol Error Rate(SER) of 9.6% for BPSK, 10.1% for QPSK, 45% for 8-PSK, 65% for 16-QAM for different values of SNR.
*  Observed an average Bit Error Rate(BER) of 9.5% for BPSK, 7.1% for QPSK, 21.2% for 8-PSK, 38.7% for 16-QAM for different values of SNR.
